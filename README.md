# Chameleon Document Repository
> All Chameleon documents to be stored here with the goal of converting all documents to markdown for ease of version control and management.

## Using this Repository  
**Updating Existing Documents:** Ensure you update the version number and the "last updated" date at the top of any document you edit. Complete rewrites require the version number before the decimal incremented while additions and edits only require the number after the decimal to be incremented. 

**Adding New Documents:** Ensure you add a version number and a "last updated" date to the top of the document. All documents should be written in markdown `.md` to help with version control and general document management. Lastly, ensure you insert the document details into the correct position within the directory below.
