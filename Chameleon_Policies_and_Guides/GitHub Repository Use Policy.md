### Version 1.1 - Last updated on the 19th April 2023

> The Chameleon **best practice policy** for how team members should use the Chameleon GitHub repositories includes the following guidelines:

### Access 
Only authorized team leaders should have *Ownership access* to the company's GitHub repository and all other *current* team members should have *Member level* access. Seniors leaving the program should be removed as members and owners at the end of each trimester. 

### Branching 
Team members should create a new branch when working on a new feature or bug fix. The branch should be named after the feature or bug fix using the following naming conventions: `memberName_featureBugfix`. This helps identify who is working on what and avoids duplicating work. 

### Committing 
Team members should commit changes regularly with clear and concise commit messages. Commits should include only the relevant changes for the feature or bug fix being worked on.

### Merging
Team members should raise a `Pull Request` for their branch into the main branch once their work on a particular feature or bug is completed. The `Pull Request` must be reviewed, and approved by one other team member. Pull requests should be done using the "pull request" feature in GitHub.

### Reviewing
Team members should review each other's work using the "pull request" feature in GitHub. Pull requests should include a summary of the changes, a list of any issues that were fixed, and a request for review. The reviewer should run the code and confim that the feature/fix does not cause errors elseware in the code base.

### Security Team members should not commit any sensitive or confidential information to the GitHub repository. They should also ensure that any third-party libraries or tools used are licensed appropriately.

### Documentation
Team members should document their code thoroughly, including any configuration or deployment instructions.

### Communication
Team members should communicate any significant changes or updates made to the GitHub repository with the rest of the team.

### Issue Tracking
Team members should use the issue tracking system within the repository to report and track any bugs or feature requests.

### Usage
Team members should use the company GitHub repository only for company-related work and not for personal projects or other non-work-related activities.


By following these guidelines, team members can ensure that the company's GitHub repository is used effectively, efficiently, and securely.
